            <p><a href="Kyaelx.html">Kyaelx</a> is the unique martial art wielded by the <a href="Aether-Touched.html">Aether-Touched</a> involving teleportation as well as attacking and defending the soul. <a href="Kyaelx.html">Kyaelx</a> has 2 main branches:</p>

<h1>Aetherian <a href="Kyaelx.html">Kyaelx</a></h1>

<p>Aetherian <a href="Kyaelx.html">Kyaelx</a> is as much a dance as it is a style of martial art with a focus on balanced offensive and defensive steps in along side your opponent. Little else is known about it.   </p>

<h1>Post-Aetherian <a href="Kyaelx.html">Kyaelx</a></h1>

<p>Post-Aetherian <a href="Kyaelx.html">Kyaelx</a> is an art of raw practicality, being brutally efficient in its offensive capability with little defense or no defense. It developed out of a need for survival and dominance in the civil war that cemented the collapse of <a href="..\Fallen Empires\The Aetherian.html">The Aetherian</a>.</p>
