<h1>Stances</h1>

<h2>Necromancy is abhorrent/ungodly</h2>

<p>Those from cultures like this are likely to treat Necromancy and reanimation of any kind as criminal, often on moral or religious grounds. This includes speaking with the dead and may include fully restoring a person to life. These cultures often have heaven like afterlives and assume the body, mind, and soul are one entity.</p>

<h2>Raising the dead is wrong</h2>

<p>Those from cultures like this are likely to treat returning the dead to life as morally or religiously wrong with raising dead being a serious crime. However these cultures may allow for or even encourage speaking with the dead or full resurrection. These cultures see the body/soul and mind as distinct entities meaning speaking with a dead mind does not require it's soul but reanimated a body and soul with no mind would be morally, like a lobotomy. These cultures often have a heavy reverence for there ancestors and some even keep <a href="..\..\temp_extracted\WorldBuildingCultureFirst\Cultural Divides\The Undeath Divide\Ancestral Libraries.html">Ancestral Libraries</a>. 
- Shorter lived/higher birth rate peoples?</p>

<h2>Raising the dead is moral</h2>

<p>Those from cultures like this are likely to view returning an inanimate corpse to life to preform labor or other tasks as similar to using donated organs. These cultures see the body and mind/soul as distinct entities meaning speaking with the dead disturbs the soul of the target. As such speaking to the dead is seen as reprehensible in these cultures as it disrupts there afterlife. These cultures are extremely reverent of there ancestors and take extremely good care of the  bodies of the dead often preserving them for as long as possible so that they may serve there communities and families in perpetuity.
- Long lived/low birth rate peoples?</p>
