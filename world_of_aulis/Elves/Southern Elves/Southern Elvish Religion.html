            <p>The southern elves monotheistic belief in <a href="Orien.html">Orien</a>, called Oriesm, is an evolved version of the northern elves Sun god with the northern god of ice and snow fading in prominence in the warmer southern climate.</p>

<p>The Oriic faith is highly militant and strongly opposes the worship of so called 'subversive' deities. Though non-Oriic religious groups exist in southern elven lands they tend towards secrecy as Oriesm calls for 'the death of those elves who subvert the will of the sun.' Non-elves are subject to lesser punishments, often being required to become 'seekers' at a monastery. The monasteries are institutions where seekers are sent to undergo Oriic re-education. They are forced to abandon their former beliefs and adopt the teachings of <a href="Orien.html">Orien</a>. The monasteries are often isolated and heavily guarded, with seekers being subjected to physical labor and mental conditioning to break their will and reshape their beliefs.</p>

<p>The Oriic doctrine of "death to those who subvert" has caused the southern elves to go on a holy war to purge followers of other faiths from neighboring lands.Â The war has led to the formation of the Order of the Golden Dawn, an elite group of Oriic warriors who serve as the military arm of the faith. These warriors are trained from a young age in the art of combat and are indoctrinated with the teachings of <a href="Orien.html">Orien</a>, making them formidable opponents on the battlefield.</p>

<p>The Oriic Inquisition, a secretive organization within the Order, is tasked with rooting out heretics and subversives within southern elven lands. They are known for their ruthless tactics, using torture and coercion to extract confessions from suspected heretics. Those found guilty of worshiping "subversive" deities are put to death in public executions, serving as a warning to others who would dare defy <a href="Orien.html">Orien</a>'s will.</p>

<p>In the heart of the Southern Elven capital lies the Sacred Flames of <a href="Orien.html">Orien</a>, a magnificent temple complex dedicated to the worship of <a href="Orien.html">Orien</a>. The temple is said to contain a sacred flame, ignited by <a href="Orien.html">Orien</a> himself, which burns brightly to symbolize the eternal power of the sun god. Pilgrims from across the land flock to the temple, seeking blessings, guidance, and protection from the wrath of <a href="Orien.html">Orien</a>.</p>

<p>Despite its dominant position, the Oriic faith is not without its critics. A small but vocal minority of southern elves, known as the Luminari, reject the militant and intolerant aspects of Oriesm. They advocate for a more inclusive and compassionate form of worship, one that recognizes the diversity of religious beliefs and practices. However, the Luminari are often persecuted by the Oriic authorities, who view them as heretics and a threat to the established order.</p>
