            <h1>Government Structure</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Select your type of government
Bureaucratic Oligarchy</p></li>
<li><p>Name the different government positions and the titles for government officials
Alderman: (a member of the council of elders), Curaca: Administrator of a region typically a high ranking member of the most powerful clan in a locality. Elder: a senior member of a clan. </p></li>
<li><p>If hereditary, how are disputes in the line of succession handled?Â 
A clan leader is responsible for selecting a successor from the ranks of the clan.</p></li>
<li>If a theocracy, how are people of other cultures/beliefs treated? How are non-believers treated?
Though not a theocracy respect for the spirits and ancestors is taken very seriously, non-believers are expected to abide by the religious norms but are free to practice there faith.</li>
<li>How content are the common people with their current government? How aware are they of upper level politics?</li>
</ul>

<h1>Social/Economic/Political Hierarchy (Class Structure)</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Number of class levels, as well as equivalent levels in different spheres of influence</p></li>
<li><p>What separates classes, how clear are the distinctions between classes
A dwarfs standing is a factor of both there standing within a clan and that clans standing within greater dwarven society. A clans standing is the primary determinate of a dwarfs standing a dwarven apprentice from the Yisa clan is more respected than the leader of an unimportant small clan. But the leader of a well respected small clan is more important than that same Yisa apprentice but less well regarded than a Yisa master. (Similar scheme to the prestige of U.S. colleges where being a student at MIT may be better regarded than a teacher at a community college)</p></li>
<li><p>How much interaction between classes occurs
Classes intermix within clans frequently but outside of the clan classes do not often interact or intermix.</p></li>
<li>Rigidity/mobility - how easy is it for someone to improve their standing or be cast down
Class mobility is stratified by ones clan, without raising the status of ones clan class mobility is limited to progression within the clans own structures. </li>
<li>Last names/titles - who gets them and why?
Last names are from ones clan, given at birth but able to be striped away. Other titles are for achievement, coming of age, or leadership.</li>
<li><p>Privileges, responsibilities of each class</p></li>
<li><p>Gender roles/levels within each class</p></li>
<li><p>How concerned is each class with bloodlines
Blood is not of consequence to a dwarf beyond who is born to what clan</p></li>
<li>Status of bastards, and does it change depending on class
Bastards are at the mercy of the clan and there parents as to where they end up. Some particularly cold fathers have branded there illegitimate children as Vica, though they are more often welcomed into one of the parents clans.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Economics</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>What type of economic system exists in your culture?</p></li>
<li><p>Industrial stage</p></li>
<li><p>Is this a period of relative prosperity or economic depression?</p></li>
<li><p>How involved is the government in matters of trade?
The government is directly involved in the facilitation of trade through guilds and visamay  versa.
As many of the major guild rely upon trade it is inherently a part of the government.</p></li>
<li><p>How culturally valued is each stage and type of labour?</p></li>
<li><p>What forms of money are used? Do they have a credit system? Loans? Interest?
Coinage is created by various clans that work closely with the major guilds, while credit systems can exist and are used they are typically only available on the scale of entire clans.</p></li>
<li><p>Any form of unemployment benefits or UBI?
All dwarves are theoretically guaranteed employment within the clan system, in practice if a clan is doing poorly some or many of its members may struggle to get work.</p></li>
