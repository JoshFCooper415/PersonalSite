            <h3><strong>Clan Structure:</strong></h3>

<p>The dwarves' societal organization is similar the clan systems of the Himalayan regions, where each clan specializes in a particular craft or trade that contributes to the overall economy. This structure fosters a strong sense of community and interdependence, with traditions and skills passed down through generations. Though clans pass down knowledge in there particular trade each clan is not the sole place of practice for that trade. Children of the clan are raised collectively until they are old enough to study under a master. Marriages between members of different clans is uncommon but fair from unheard of. Clans vary wildly in size from the largest of the farming clans with more than 5,000 brothers and sisters to the most specialized gem cutters with less than a dozen. </p>

<h3><strong>Government Structure:</strong></h3>

<p>Highly organized, with a strong central government and a system of labor tribute called mit'a. Dwarves have a social structure with a strong emphasis on community and collective labor and every dwarf contributes their skills to the community as part of a societal duty. This extends to a complex network of roads, aqueducts, and passes connecting cities and clans.
At the heart of the dwarven government is the Council of Elders, a group composed of the heads of the most influential clans. This council is responsible for making decisions that affect the entire dwarven society, from trade policies to defense strategies. Each elder represents the interests of their clan, but they are also expected to consider the well-being of the entire dwarven population in their deliberations. </p>

<h3><strong>Spiritual Beliefs:</strong></h3>

<p>Dwarven cultures often include a profound animistic belief that every element of the natural world is imbued with its own spirit. From the ancient, craggy peaks that pierce the sky to the smallest pebble hidden in the depths of the earth, each is considered alive and pulsing with spiritual energy. This reverence for nature shapes their entire existence, guiding their interactions with the environment, their technological advancements, and their societal norms. Sacred sites dot the landscape, serving as nexus points for spiritual communion and rituals that honor the spirits dwelling within stone, stream, and sky. Legends of ancient spirits and legendary heroes who walked in harmony with the earth are passed down through generations, reinforcing the deep, unbreakable bond between the dwarves and the living world they cherish. This belief is encapsulated in the dwarven saying "Seirie" which literally translates to: in every stone a spirit.</p>
