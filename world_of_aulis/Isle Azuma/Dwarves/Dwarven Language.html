            <h1>Formal / Spiritual</h1>

<p>Formal dwarven also known as 'Stonescript' is derived from a ancient version of the dwarven language but it is still used in spiritual, legal, and formal contexts while many dwarves can understand spoken Stonescript to some degree few can read text written in this archaic language.</p>

<h1>Informal / Spoken</h1>

<p>Informal dwarven often simply referred to as dwarven or 'Simple Stonescript' is significantly more streamlined than Stonescript. While Simple Stonescript can be written in practice it is mostly spoken and those who write and read Simple Stonescript most often are curriers and Merikaian accountants. </p>

<h4><strong>The Dwarven Language</strong></h4>

<p>The Dwarven language, rich in history and symbolism, is a reflection of the race's deep connection to their ancestry, land, and spirituality. It is a complex and intricate language, characterized by its broad vocabulary related to stone, metal, and earth, and its distinct phonetic structure that resonates within the cavernous halls of their mountain homes. The language is divided into two main versions: the archaic and spiritual 'Stonescript', and the commonly spoken 'Simple Stonescript'.</p>

<h4><strong>Stonescript</strong></h4>

<p>Stonescript, the ancient form of the Dwarven language, is used in spiritual, legal, and formal contexts. It is a complex and precise language, with a unique script carved into stone. Its written form consists of angular and geometric characters that interlock, forming larger compositions - much like the pieces of a grand, stone mosaic.</p>

<p>Stonescript is the language of the Stonescripts, the sacred texts that form the basis of Dwarven law and spirituality. Therefore, its knowledge is considered sacred and is mostly retained by the Shai Clan, the spiritual leaders, and scholars.</p>

<p>While most Dwarves can understand spoken Stonescript to a degree, few can read and write it due to its complexity and the years of study required to master it. As such, Stonescript is considered a language of prestige and power, often used in rituals, declarations of law, and in carving oaths into Oathstones.</p>

<p><strong>Structure:</strong><br />
Stonescript is a logographic language, meaning each word has a single, distinct meaning, unlike the agglutinative languages prevalent in the material realm. This allows for nuanced and precise communication, reflecting the interconnectedness of all things.</p>

<p><strong>Vocabulary:</strong><br />
The vocabulary of Stonescript is divided into two major categories: celestial and terrestrial. Celestial terms refer to the various deities and spirits that are associated with the natural world and the elements. Terrestrial terms refer to the objects and materials found in the material realm, reflecting the practical and material aspects of life.</p>

<p><strong>Grammar:</strong><br />
Stonescript grammar is complex, with a system of noun declensions, verb conjugations, and case markings. Additionally, the language employs a complex system of kinship terms that denote the social standing and relationships between different individuals and clans.</p>

<p><strong>Symbolism:</strong><br />
The Stonescripts are not merely a system of words; they are infused with deep symbolism. Each symbol and image carries specific meanings, often reflecting the essence of concepts or concepts. For example, the symbol of water, known as 'Halu,' is represented by a flowing stream of flowing water or a single drop of water.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Significance:</strong><br />
The language is deeply intertwined with the culture of the dwarves, shaping their religious rituals, laws, and customs. It is a living testament to the enduring spirit of the dwarven people and their deep connection to nature.</p>

<p><strong>Influence:</strong><br />
The languages of the dwarves have been greatly influenced by the surrounding languages of the material realm. As the dwarves traded and interacted with humans and other beings from different realms, their language absorbed elements of those languages, enriching it with new words and concepts.</p>

<h4><strong>Simple Stonescript</strong></h4>

<p>For daily conversation, Dwarves use Simple Stonescript. It is a more streamlined version of the language, with simplified grammar and vocabulary, making it quicker to speak and easier to learn. Despite its name, Simple Stonescript still contains many of the nuances of the ancient language, including its rich collection of terms related to stonework, metalwork, and the natural world.</p>

<p>Simple Stonescript can be written, but it is primarily a spoken language. Those who write in Simple Stonescript are usually couriers, merchants, and accountants who need to record transactions, messages, or inventories. Simple Stonescript is also the language of choice for Dwarven songs and tales, making it the living, breathing heart of Dwarven culture and tradition.</p>

<p>Despite the division, these two forms of the Dwarven language are interdependent. Stonescript keeps the historical and spiritual roots of the Dwarves alive, while Simple Stonescript allows the language to continue evolving and adapting to modern times.</p>
