            <p><a href="Gyn.html">Gyn</a> are a very large domesticated beast of burden. Most arkeological evidence points to them having been domesticated when they were much smaller and then them being bred for there size, docility, and muscle. A fully grown male <a href="Gyn.html">Gyn</a> can weight more than 3 tons, with females weighing just over 2 tons! While they are too skittish to be ridden into battle they make for exceptional beasts of burden and there long lives make them a very valuable asset. </p>

<p>In addition to being exceptionally strong the average male <a href="Gyn.html">Gyn</a> can maintain its pace almost an entire day though it can only do so under significant load for a fraction of the time.</p>

<p>Female <a href="Gyn.html">Gyn</a> are notably less common then there male counter parts with 1 female for every 5 males, with a gestation period of a year this means even an increasable successful fertile female will have only 2-4 daughters in its life-time. Being less suited for labor one would assume the female would be less valuable but there scarcity and importance to breeding <a href="Gyn.html">Gyn</a> makes them highly sought after with one female <a href="Gyn.html">Gyn</a> able to be sold at 3 to 4 times the price of a male. </p>
