            <p><a href="Duchess Valeria of Camina.html">Duchess Valeria of Camina</a> is an imposing women standing at 6'4''. Some say she has [[The Gaunt|Gaunt]] blood in her veins others say its giant blood. She was only 5 years old when her father was killed in <a href="..\..\The Red Seige.html">The Red Seige</a>. 
She has ample hatred for <a href="..\..\Norte Reia.html">Norte Reia</a> and <a href="..\..\Religon\The Church of Reia.html">The Church of Reia</a>, but her position is more tenuous than it may seem with her relying on other lands in <a href="..\..\Norte Reia.html">Norte Reia</a> for weapons and armor. Though she could withhold vast amounts of food from the northern provinces her armies are only truly suited for defense, a defense that could be easily disrupted by <a href="..\..\Norte Reia.html">Norte Reia</a>'s deep pockets.</p>

<p>[[Duchess Valeria of Camina|Duchess Valeria]] acts as the unofficial head of her duchy's unique polytheistic faith, though she only serves this role begrudgingly preferring that others worship in the way they see fit. This makes the <a href="..\..\Regions\Duchy of Camina.html">Duchy of Camina</a> a paradise free from religious persecution for many.</p>
