            <p>The <a href="Marques de Terranova.html">Marques de Terranova</a> is a grizzled 40 year old mountain of a man scars etch his face and body with a map of battles fought. A jagged line across his cheekbone from a Mirian Lion claw, a missing fingertip from a logging accident, and a massive wound on his shoulder from a run in with a wendigo. </p>

<p>The <a href="Marques de Terranova.html">Marques de Terranova</a> is a stalwart of <a href="..\..\Religon\The Old Gods of Llagris.html">The Old Gods of Llagris</a> and sees <a href="..\..\Religon\The Church of Reia.html">The Church of Reia</a> as interlopers in his lands, though few church officials are brave or foolhardy enough to take up residence in <a href="..\..\Regions\March Terranova.html">March Terranova</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="Marques de Terranova.html">Marques de Terranova</a> has no wife and no high born children only an adopted daughter to whom he intends to bequeath his title and duties.</p>
