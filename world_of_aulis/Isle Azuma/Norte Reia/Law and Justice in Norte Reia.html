            <h1>Guards / Lamplighters / Nightwatchmen</h1>

<p>Professional or semi professional Law keepers on the pay roll of the nobility to protect and administer the lands around that law keeper are called guards. Guards are officially employed by <a href="Religon\The Church of Reia.html">The Church of Reia</a> and sponsored by the local nobility. In small towns these guards would be volunteers who work part time as a town guard for the extra coin, prestige, or power. In larger towns or near the lords manor guards may be knights, priests, or former mercenaries.  Guards can be easily distinguished from the regular populace from the silver or gold earing of a <a href="Religon\Rising Crown.html">Rising Crown</a> even while they are not on duty.</p>

<p>Lamplighters is the name given to city law keepers either professional or volunteers, they are not given a <a href="Religon\Rising Crown.html">Rising Crown</a> by <a href="Religon\The Church of Reia.html">The Church of Reia</a> and often have no uniforms at all, may do still have metal ear piercings though they are much less often genuine silver or gold.</p>

<p>Nightwatchmen are a strictly professional organization with some guards also being nightwatchmen, there duties differ from a standard guard in that they are trained primary for combat both with criminals and monsters. Though the quality of this training varies greatly they are often a local areas only premiant defenders.</p>

<h3>Silver and Gold Earring</h3>

<p>Silver and gold are very commonly used in earrings as a indicator that one is trustworthy. Piercing the skin with silver or gold is used a short hand proof that you are a not a dangerous magikal creature as for such creatures these piercings are quite painful and can interfere with there magic. 
It is for this reason that many powerful spellcasters also choose to forgo silver and gold piercings as they can interfere with more complex or potent magic. Even weak sorceress must forgo them entirely or suffer constant headaches. Silver <a href="Religon\Rising Crown.html">Rising Crown</a>'s are much more common than there gold counterparts. Only professional guards trained in [[Cabcia|The Royal Capitol]] get golden [[Rising Crown|crowns]], though the captain of a town guard may be sent to <a href="Towns and Cities\Cabcia.html">Cabcia</a> for training in practice this is a rare occurrence so most folks will never see a  golden [[Rising Crown|crown]].</p>

<h1><a href="..\..\Magiks\Caedex.html">Caedex</a> / Judges / Courts</h1>

<p>For judgment to be passed on a known or suspected criminal two parties must be present, 'an officer of the laws of man, and an officer of the laws of the divine'.  In practice this means a representative of <a href="Religon\The Church of Reia.html">The Church of Reia</a> and a representative of the local lord or the royal family. Though all lords in <a href="Norte Reia.html">Norte Reia</a> are officially both the requirement is for two separate parties to fulfil each roll, for a lord it is typically the court priest but there have also been cases of a lord and lady passing judgment without a priest. For important or difficult cases <a href="Religon\The Church of Reia.html">The Church of Reia</a>'s <a href="..\..\Magiks\Caedex.html">Caedex</a> will serve as the church's representative, offering there services for the case. The role of the clergy is that of an observer, officiator, and advisor, with the local lord or reprehensive acting as a judge and jury.</p>
