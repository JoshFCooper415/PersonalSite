            <p>The Norte Reian Royal Gold Policy refers to a set of economic and political measures implemented by the Crown of Norte Reia to manage the nation's vast gold reserves and maintain its position as the world's largest gold supplier. This policy has been a cornerstone of Norte Reian economic strategy since the discovery of major gold deposits in Cabcia, the kingdom's capital region, approximately 50 years ago.</p>

<h2>Historical Context</h2>

<p>The discovery of gold in Cabcia transformed Norte Reia from a modest agricultural kingdom into a global economic powerhouse. The sudden influx of wealth posed significant challenges to the existing economic structure and necessitated the development of a comprehensive policy to manage this new resource.</p>

<p>The royal family maintains exclusive rights to all gold mining operations within Norte Reia. Private individuals or companies may be granted mining concessions, but these are strictly regulated and subject to heavy taxation. The crown carefully regulates the amount of gold released into the market to maintain high prices and prevent market saturation. This strategy has been instrumental in preserving Norte Reia's economic dominance.</p>
