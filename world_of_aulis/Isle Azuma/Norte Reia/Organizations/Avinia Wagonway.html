            <p><a href="Avinia Wagonway.html">Avinia Wagonway</a> is the first wagon way on <a href="..\..\..\The Aulis System\Isle Azuma.html">Isle Azuma</a>, named for the province in the <a href="..\Regions\Duchy of Camina.html">Duchy of Camina</a> in which it resides, the wagon way was introduced as a way to quickly and cheaply move goods from the port city of <a href="..\Towns and Cities\Onda.html">Onda</a> to the wealthy <a href="..\Towns and Cities\Valeria City.html">Valeria City</a>. Its creations was financed by [[The Knights Valar]], and it is run by the now wealthy <a href="..\Important Figures in Norte Reia\Esteban Compote DiNovo.html">Esteban Compote DiNovo</a>.</p>

<p>Not everyone is happy about the new wagon way. The stopover town of <a href="..\Towns and Cities\Foza.html">Foza</a> which gained much of its wealth by providing horses and housing to traveling merchants and by acting as a trade hub between the two cities, has taken the creation of the <a href="Avinia Wagonway.html">Avinia Wagonway</a> as an assault on there way of life and continued existence, some of them have even taken to sabotaging the wagon way.</p>

<p>The wagon chain is pulled by a team of <a href="..\..\Gyn.html">Gyn</a> that pull the massive system of connected wagons forward at a quick pace. Goods and persons on the <a href="Avinia Wagonway.html">Avinia Wagonway</a> can make it from <a href="..\Towns and Cities\Onda.html">Onda</a> to <a href="..\Towns and Cities\Valeria City.html">Valeria City</a> in an afternoon!</p>
