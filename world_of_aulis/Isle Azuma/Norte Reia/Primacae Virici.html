            <p><a href="Primacae Virici.html">Primacae Virici</a> is the policy by which power is handed down in a noble house. It is the first child who shows latent magikal potential, with preference first for males and secondarily for the oldest. So important is having a head of house of the magikal persuasion that on rare occasions even a bastard child may ascend to the position should the 'rightful' heirs lack any magikal capacity.   </p>

<p>In Reian noble culture a noble child is not even considered to have been born until it exhibits some magical capacity. This is taken so far that there exist a class of so called '<a href="Legitimate Basterds.html">Legitimate Basterds</a>' who are legitimate nobles by blood but not considered as 'real' noble children by their families. </p>
