            <p><a href="Cuvero Barony.html">Cuvero Barony</a> is best known for its vineyards though they also export wheat, barley, animal products, and mahogany wood. Despite its small size <a href="Cuvero Barony.html">Cuvero Barony</a> is well regarded and well liked for its export of luxury wine. </p>

<p><a href="Cuvero Barony.html">Cuvero Barony</a> was one of the regions most effected by the wanton destruction of <a href="..\The Red Seige.html">The Red Seige</a> with its lands taking nearly a decade to recover. For this reason Cuvero wine from 40-50 years ago is highly sought after for its rarity and unique flavor(though it is not that good in reality).  </p>
