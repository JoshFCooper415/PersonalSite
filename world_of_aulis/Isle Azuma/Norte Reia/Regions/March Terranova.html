The march is known primary for the dangerous wilderness that permeates it. Some crops like buckwheat can grow in the chaparral of <a href="March Terranova.html">March Terranova</a> but its main exports are timber and hunted game, with some silver from <a href="..\Towns and Cities\Silverstead.html">Silverstead</a> being exported. </p>
