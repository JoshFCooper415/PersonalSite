            <h3>Commerce</h3>

<p>The Mynoans are famous around the island for their exotic fur trade</p>

<h3>Culture</h3>

<p>Fur trapping and trading is part of a coming-of-age ritual in <a href="Myno.html">Myno</a>. 
Wealth is indicated by the type of fur one wears. Poor citizens do not wear a fur, while the richest sport <a href="..\..\..\Monsters\Nieve.html">Nieve</a> furs.</p>

<h3>Politics</h3>

<p>The Esnia family has held iron-clad control over the distribution of trading licences for as long as anyone can remember. They sell licenses to aspiring hunters, allowing them to hunt larger, more profitable game like "snow leopards", "Elk",  "<a href="..\..\..\Monsters\Nieve.html">Nieve</a>" which are fashionable among the rich. </p>

<p>The <a href="Myno.html">Myno</a>ans treat the <a href="..\..\..\Non-Agrarian cultures\Raoa.html">Raoa</a> as barbarians and terrorists.</p>
