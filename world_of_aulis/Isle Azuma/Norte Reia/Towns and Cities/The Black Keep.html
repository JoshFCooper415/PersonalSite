            <p><a href="The Black Keep.html">The Black Keep</a> is the only temple to <a href="..\..\..\The Blind God.html">The Blind God</a> and a training ground for his acolytes. <a href="The Black Keep.html">The Black Keep</a>'s monks hold the secret to the creation of black powder and it is said <a href="..\..\..\The Blind God.html">The Blind God</a> himself holds the secret of how to forge guns. </p>

<p>The monks of <a href="The Black Keep.html">The Black Keep</a> are raised from childhood often being found as beggars or orphans in <a href="..\Regions\Felres County.html">Felres County</a>. The training they endure is beyond brutal and few survive long enough to receive there own musket(or very rarely a pistol). </p>

<p>The monks of <a href="The Black Keep.html">The Black Keep</a> are in many ways respected by the common folk of <a href="..\..\..\Fallen Empires\Llagris.html">Llagris</a> and <a href="..\Norte Reia.html">Norte Reia</a> but, this respect is equal parts awe and fear. Regular folk do not understand how they could be both kind and protective to the people of <a href="..\..\..\Fallen Empires\Llagris.html">Llagris</a> and so brutal to their clergy. </p>
