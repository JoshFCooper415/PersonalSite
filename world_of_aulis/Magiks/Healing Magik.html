            <p>There exist a number of Magiks that can heal mortal wounds in a matter of seconds. These spells have significant consequences as rather than just replacing the injury with a healed version they speed up or radically alter the bodies normal healing progress typically in a way that causes a large amount of pain. 
<strong>Physical Repercussions</strong>:  Healers  suffer from premature aging, or those healed could experience unexpected side effects, such as enhanced sensitivity or altered abilities.
<strong>Wear and Tear</strong>: Repeated healing can cause "healing scars" of a magical nature, where soldiers bear the marks of accelerated healing, affecting their physical capabilities and lifespan.</p>

<h1>Healing Disease</h1>

<p>Healing diseases that are not resistant to magikal purging can be simple though a spell caster of uncommon skill is required to preform this minor miracle. Removing diseases that are attuned to magik is a much more difficult and challenging procedure.</p>
