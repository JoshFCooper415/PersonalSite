            <p>All magic requires a source of <a href="Sol.html">Sol</a>, where <a href="Sol.html">Sol</a> is transformed into the spell losing some <a href="Sol.html">Sol</a> as heat and <a href="MR.html">MR</a>. The source of <a href="Sol.html">Sol</a> is the defining feature for <a href="Types of Magecraft.html">Types of Magecraft</a>. </p>

<h2>Transient vs. Perpetual Magik</h2>

<p>Magecraft is split between Transient and Perpetual sources of <a href="Sol.html">Sol</a> a Perpetual sources are the Sun, Geothermal activity or similar. While nearly anything can be used as a transient source. Magiks that use transient sources are inherently extractive, a given transient source can only be used so many times before turning to dust. Perpetual sources can be exhausted in a region but only temporarily as they replenish naturally over time, it is for this reason that [[temp_extracted/WorldBuildingCultureFirst/Elves/Northern Elves/Northern elvish religious beliefs|Northern elvish religious beliefs]] dictate that it is immoral to use transient sources of <a href="Sol.html">Sol</a> viewing it as destructive and barbaric.</p>
