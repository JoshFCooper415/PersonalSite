The Orcs of Aulis are a nomadic people with a rich history of survival as pastoralists and hunter-gathers. A typical orcish tribe spends the warmer months in the hills or mountains migrating to warmer climates for the winter following the migratory patterns of their prey. 
Despite their nomadic ways, the orcs have a rich oral tradition of epic myths and legends passed down through skilled storytellers. These tales recount the mythical origins of the orc people, the heroic deeds of legendary ancestors, and memorable events throughout their history. Storytelling is a revered art form.
Hospitality is a deeply ingrained virtue among the Orcs, as it was in ancient Persian culture. Welcoming travelers and offering them shelter and sustenance is a matter of honor, fostering a sense of community and mutual respect among the nomadic tribes.
Orcs decorate their tents, weapons, and even their bodies with intricate colorful geometric patterns and stylized nature motifs. This artwork, while aesthetically ornate, also holds spiritual meaning which indicates the achievements that the Orc has completed in their lifetime.
The nomadic culture of the orcs often results in clashes with those who claim ownership over the lands they roam. Many an extermination campaign has been launched over Orcish hunters 'hunting' farm animals.</p>
