            <p>The Gaunt are larger paler elves, appearing after the <a href="..\Fall of the Imperium.html">Fall of the Imperium</a> alongside the wood elves. Not much is known about these rare creatures, there exist no accounts of ones death or birth leading many to believe they are divine in nature. In reality they are a mix of elven and giant blood. Some whisper that they are the offspring of the gods themselves, sent to guide and protect the elven people in the aftermath of <a href="..\Fallen Empires\The Imperium.html">The Imperium</a>'s collapse.
The Gaunt have no kingdom of their own but are instead spread thinly across the vast forests of the north, living in harmonious isolation. Their settlements, if they can be called such, are beautifully integrated into their natural surroundings, often consisting of homes carved from the trunks of colossal trees or cunningly concealed among the boughs.

In the centuries since their appearance, the Gaunt elves have become the stuff of legend and myth. Many believe that they are the guardians of a hidden treasure, a trove of knowledge and magical artifacts from the fallen Imperium. Others claim that they possess the ability to read the future, and that they move quietly through the world, nudging events in the direction they believe will bring about the greatest good.</p>
