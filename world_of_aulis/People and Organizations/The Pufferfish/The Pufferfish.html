            <p>The Pufferfish is a pirate vessel captained by <a href="n'Resh the defiant.html">n'Resh the defiant</a>. The vessel targets ships 'owned an operated by kings' but will absolutely plunder merchant vessels with tenuous connections to any crow. </p>

<h2>The ship</h2>

<p><a href="The Pufferfish.html">The Pufferfish</a> is a massive ship being nearly sixty feet long with three sails and a huge cargo bay for stolen goods. The ship is outfitted in many haphazardly created weapons with some of the more effective being deck mounted catapults, holes for blow guns, and a large front mounted spike for ramming. </p>

<h2>The booty</h2>

<p>The crew of <a href="The Pufferfish.html">The Pufferfish</a> uses its acquired funds to create weapons for the ship, pay for repairs and supplies, and to hire spies and mercenaries to destabilize royal regimes.</p>
