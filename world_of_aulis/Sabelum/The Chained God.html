<em>The Enslaved God</em> 
<em>The Prisoner</em> </p>

<p><a href="The Chained God.html">The Chained God</a> is less a god than a slave, the followers of the chained god believe the deity to be in there dept for their faith and in exchange it must give them power. Worship, if it can even be called that, of <a href="The Chained God.html">The Chained God</a> is highly illegal the world over save <a href="Sabelum.html">Sabelum</a> where it is the primary religion. The worshipers of <a href="The Chained God.html">The Chained God</a> are seen as petulant children by many but the implication of their dogmatic faith that a deity should be owned and controlled is a terrifying notation to god-fearing priests and men the world over.</p>

<h2>Depiction</h2>

<p><a href="The Chained God.html">The Chained God</a> is often depicted as a giant man-like hunched creature with large tusks and no face, chained to stones at the in a deep cave.</p>

<h2>Subversive worship</h2>

<p>Not all who worship <a href="The Chained God.html">The Chained God</a> believe it is the deity who owes them, some believe and argue for the unchaining of there god. These worshipers are very rare but <a href="The Chained God.html">The Chained God</a> is happy to grant power to those seeking to free him. </p>
