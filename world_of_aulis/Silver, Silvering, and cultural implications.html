            <p>Many monsters feared by the normal people of the world are terrifying simply because they cannot be harmed by normal means. Silver weapons then, though expensive to produce hold a special place in the minds of most common folk.  As they are expensive most common folk will never own a silvered blade though for the more well-to-do a silver knife is a common coming of age gift. For most peasants a silver weapon is singular, likely held a lords estate in case of monster attacks. </p>

<p>Silver itself has taken on many cultural practices, for example a particularly superstitious commoner may pay upfront in silver coins to an untrusted stranger.    </p>
