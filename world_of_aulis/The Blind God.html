<a href="The Blind God.html">The Blind God</a> tolerates no other deities. According to the monks of <a href="Isle Azuma\Norte Reia\Towns and Cities\The Black Keep.html">The Black Keep</a> he mutilated himself to prevent his magik from destroying the world and thusly sees the magiks of the world as a grave threat.</p>

<h2>The Argentum Pontiff</h2>

<p>He wears a blindfold over his two lead replaced eyes and over his two cut off ears filled in with molten silver. His skin is covered in burns and argentum and he is castrated. He wears only chains of argentum. He is deaf, blind, unable to feel, and unable to use magik. It is said that he can speak to <a href="The Blind God.html">The Blind God</a> and that this is his only remaining sense.</p>
