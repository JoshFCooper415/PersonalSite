<li><p>What separates classes, how clear are the distinctions between classes
A dwarfs standing is a factor of both there standing within a clan and that clans standing within greater dwarven society. A clans standing is the primary determinate of a dwarfs standing a dwarven apprentice from the Yisa clan is more respected than the leader of an unimportant small clan. But the leader of a well respected small clan is more important than that same Yisa apprentice but less well regarded than a Yisa master. (Similar scheme to the prestige of U.S. colleges where being a student at MIT may be better regarded than a teacher at a community college)</p></li>
<li><p>How much interaction between classes occurs
Classes intermix within clans frequently but outside of the clan classes do not often interact or intermix.</p></li>

<li>Status of bastards, and does it change depending on class
