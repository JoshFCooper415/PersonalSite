            <p>Mother and father gods. The gods of snow, ice, and winter as well as fire, sun, light.</p>

<p>The mother is, the ice queen, mother of the first elves</p>

<p>The father is, the sun king, father of the first elves</p>

<p>The Ice Queen sculptured the bodies of the first elves from ice imbuing them with the strength to survive in the north. The Sun King crafted spirits of light to imbue in the sculptures giving the first elves the gift of fire.</p>

<p>The sun king is also responsible for the world of spirits, and as such has Gyrfalcon who serves as a psychopomp. </p>

<h2>Funerary Rites</h2>

<p>Elves extremely low birth rates mean that physical labor is in very short supply. This combines with the existing norther elvish religious belief in a separate soul and body, meaning what is done with the body is of no consequence to the soul. Unlike many cultures this creates circumstances where necromancy is not only morally acceptable but practical and even ethically desirable. This means that when an elves spirit departs their body the body can be repurposed. In a funeral only the parts of the body that can be easily maintained are kept and the rest is burned giving the elven undead their signature black skeletal bones. Though these reanimated remains hold no capacity for higher thought and are in many ways little more than skilled beasts of burden they are still respected as gifts from their ancestors. The dead are then adorned with black clothes, marking them as undead.</p>
